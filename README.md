# Local First

This is text in my README.

And here is some more text. Now some more text. I am making some changes but not commiting. 

I am the collaborator and this is my code. I think this is the best way to write this.

Also, check this.

Here is a great idea. This is someone else working at the same time and commiting the changes.
